# pacmanSearchAgents

For the first part of this project it is a pacman game that implements the DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* searches in order for pacman to find the path in order to get to the dot in the maze.

For the second part of this project we were first tasked with editing the stateState(), the goalState(), the and the getSucessors() methods in order to have pacman get 4 food in the four corners of the pacman layout. After that we were tasked with implementing a heuristic for the four corners problem for our a* search. Next we were tasked with implementing the heuristic for pacman to eat all of the food on the map. Finally we were tasked with creating a method that would just take pacman to the closest possible dot.
